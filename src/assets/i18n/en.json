      "first": "Hello, my name is Jorge Jesús Campoy López and I am passionate about web development, since I was a child I always liked a lot, drawing, medicine, and computer science, although from a young age I have dedicated myself to hospitality to help my family, some time later and thanks to a friend I entered the world of programming and marveled at the possibilities it offers, I got down to work to discover all the things I can create"
